# Bioinformatics to ML Scientist: 6-Month Transition Plan

---

## Conversation Summary & Roadmap

**User Background:**

- Current job: Bioinformatician at an NGS company  
- Work: Proteomics pipelines, bash/Nextflow/Python scripting, data visualization  
- Goal: Transition into Machine Learning / Applied Scientist / ML Scientist roles in BioAI  

---

## Step 1 — Strategy Overview

1. **Skill Gap Analysis:**

   - Current: Bioinformatics pipelines, proteomics, Python scripting  
   - Missing: Machine learning, deep learning, transformers, protein/gene sequence modeling, ML interpretability

2. **Portfolio Approach:**

   - Build 3 high-impact projects showcasing ML + Bio knowledge  
   - Target projects that are:
     - Biologically meaningful
     - Industry-relevant
     - Show different ML competencies (classical ML, deep learning, transformer/foundation models)

3. **Timeline:**

   - **6 months** preparation  
   - **2.5 hours/day on weekdays**, **6 hours/day on weekends** (~24.5 hours/week)
