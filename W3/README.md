## W1: Introduction
### W1L02: What is a Neural Network
A simplest neuron can be a Relu (rectified linear unit) as **activation function** with one input and output. A more complex neuron netwokrs can take more features as input.

### W1L03: Supervised Learning and NN
Common types of NN:
* Standard NN: prediction of property price
* Convolutional NN: image
* Recurrent NN: sequential data such as text and audio

Data structure:
* Structured data: tabular
* Unstructured data: audio, image, text

### W1L04: Why is deep learning taking off?

Performance keeps improving from:
* Having more data
* Having bigger NN
So if you only have a small dataset, traditional ML (SVM, logistic regression) probably work better than NN.

Scale drives deep learning progress:

* Data (we have more data thanks to digitalization)
* Computation (GPU)
* Algorithms (eg.to speed up computation by using relu with faster gradient descent instead of sigmoid)
