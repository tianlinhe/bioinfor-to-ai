    "I recommend using Anaconda to manage your python environment, so that any packages install in this project (e.g. scikit-learn) does not interfere with others. To install Anaconda, go to [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install).\n",

    "### IDE\n",
    "I recommend using (Visual Studio Code)[https://code.visualstudio.com/]. It supports all operation systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS), has integrated AI code editor (GitHub Copilot etc), and works great with jupyter notebooks. And it's free!"
